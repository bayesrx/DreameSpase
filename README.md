# DreameSpase

A package for fitting the model in the forthcoming paper, *Dual Random Effect and Main Effect Spatial Selection for Pathology Imaging and Genomics Data*. You can install the current version of *DreameSpase* using `devtools` as follows:

```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nateosher/DIMPLE")
```

To install with vignettes (which I recommend), use the command:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nateosher/DIMPLE", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

This will take a few minutes, since the code in the vignette (which involves fitting a small version of the model) has to run.
